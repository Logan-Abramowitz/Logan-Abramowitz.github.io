## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a rising junior at Cornell University double majoring in Computer Science and Operations Research & Information Engineering. I’ve always been drawn to problems that involve data—whether that means finding patterns, improving systems, or trying to predict what comes next.

At Cornell, I’ve worked on a research project with the ORIE department to help make the North Campus Mailroom more efficient. I’ve also written a report on Formula 1 racing for one of my ORIE classes, where I looked into how data could help explain team performance.

In terms of my experience, I’ve interned with Stand Out for College and StratusX, and I was vice president of Cornell’s Cybersecurity Club. Through these experiences, I've gained many valuable skills such as teamwork and leadership. I’ve also learned how much I enjoy digging into data and using tools like machine learning to turn information into insight.

As for my passions outside of an academic or professional setting, I love spending time with my friends—whether that’s bowling, having a catch, playing wiffle ball, or just hanging out inside playing a board game. I also enjoy building anything and everything, from computers to furniture to my all-time favorite: Legos.

This site is mainly a place for me to share some of the work I’ve done so far, and hopefully a way for people to get to know me a bit better. With that in mind, please take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>, as they contain a bunch more information.
