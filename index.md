## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a rising junior at Cornell University double majoring in Computer Science and Operations Research & Information Engineering. I’ve always been drawn to problems that involve data — whether that means finding patterns, improving systems, or trying to predict what comes next.

At Cornell, I’ve worked on a research project with the ORIE department to help make the campus mailroom more efficient. I’ve also written a report on Formula 1 racing for one of my ORIE classes, where I looked into how data could help explain team performance. I’m planning to share both of those projects here.

I’ve interned with Stand Out for College and StratusX, and I was vice president of Cornell’s Cybersecurity Club for a year. Through these experiences, I’ve learned how much I enjoy digging into data and using tools like machine learning to turn information into insight.

This site is a place for me to share some of the work I’ve done so far, and hopefully a way to connect with others who care about the same things.

Please take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
